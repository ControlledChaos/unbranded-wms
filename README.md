## Overview

I created this to demonstrate that one can "fork" WordPress in relatively short time. There have been comments made by influential folks in the WordPress organization, particularly the most influential individual, that are condescending, dismissive and passive-aggressive, daring others to fork WordPress. Hopefully this little experiment will prove that taking that challenge is relatively easy, albeit tedious.

Also, as I am developing a highly modified fork of WordPress formerly known as IntegratePress, I need a management system to blog about its development. I don't want to use WordPress for the interim site, to use ClassicPress or calmPress would feel odd, and other systems are out of the question for similar reason.

So this system will be used on the [integratepress.org](integratepress.org) website for the time being.

## Name, and No Name

The type of software commonly called "content management system" have come a long way since therm was coined. This product is being referred to as a website management system (WMS) because it, like the software from whence it was derived, does far more than manage content, even out of the box. And the term "website management system" is particularly accurate when in multi-site mode. I started calling IntegratePress a website management system so this to shall be called such.

This product has no brand. It has no trademarked logo, no copyrighted slogan. The reason for this is the same as the reason for removing the brand name from what was called IntegratePress, and which will be discussed on the aforementioned website that will distribute it.

For the time being, suffice it to say that this and the other WMS can be white labeled. Your brand can be added during the installation process and can be changed at any time in the root config file.

## Distribution

This product, including images, graphical vector markup, documentation, and any works not described here, are released for public consumption ad libitum, ad infinitum. Please read the DISCLAIMER file included in this product's root directory.

## Development Time Log

The following is a log of the development sessions for this project. It is recorded as encouragement to others in creating their own fork of WordPress, to show that it can be done in relatively short time if no major changes are implemented.
